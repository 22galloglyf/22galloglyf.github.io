   <h1>Quick hummis recipe</h1>

    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummis, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

    Hummis is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
   <li> 6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
   <li> A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
   <li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
   <li> A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
   <li> Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
   <li> Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
   <li> Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
   <li> If you want a coarse "chunky" hummis, process it for a short time</li>
   <li> If you want a smooth hummis, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ol>
   <p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
   
    <h2>Storage</h2>

   <p> Refrigerate the finished hummis in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>

   <p> Hummis is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
